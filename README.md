This project is designed to provide a robust and flexible GraphQL API for managing your data efficiently.

Have you ever thought about a social network with only video creation and access to exclusive content that only a few members will be able to make available? A new world in a new circle. A new circle and endless possibilities. Come to the new, come and meet our Social Networking App.
It is now in development, but don't be sad that the roadmap will be out soon, soon ;)

JÃ¡ pensou em uma rede social apenas com criaÃ§Ã£o de vÃ­deos e acesso hÃ¡ um conteÃºdo exclusivo que apenas alguns membros poderÃ£o disponibilizar? Um mundo novo em um cÃ­rculo novo. Um novo cÃ­rculo e infinitas possibilidades. Venha para o novo, venha conhecer nosso App de rede social.
Ele agora estÃ¡ em desenvolvimento, mas nÃ£o fique triste que logo, logo sairÃ¡ o roadmap ;)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
